  <Param tooltip="The simplification process tries to do not affect mesh boundaries during simplification" isxmlparam="0" name="PreserveBoundary" description="Preserve Boundary of the mesh" type="RichBool" value="false"/>
  <Param tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border. Admitted range of values (0,+inf). " isxmlparam="0" name="BoundaryWeight" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" type="RichFloat" value="1"/>
  <Param tooltip="Try to avoid face flipping effects and try to preserve the original orientation of the surface" isxmlparam="0" name="PreserveNormal" description="Preserve Normal" type="RichBool" value="true"/>
  <Param tooltip="Avoid all the collapses that should cause a topology change in the mesh (like closing holes, squeezing handles, etc). If checked the genus of the mesh should stay unchanged." isxmlparam="0" name="PreserveTopology" description="Preserve Topology" type="RichBool" value="true"/>
  <Param tooltip="Each collapsed vertex is placed in the position minimizing the quadric error.&#xa; It can fail (creating bad spikes) in case of very flat areas. &#xa;If disabled edges are collapsed onto one of the two original vertices and the final mesh is composed by a subset of the original vertices.

  <Param tooltip="Add additional simplification constraints that improves the quality of the simplification of the planar portion of the mesh, as a side effect, more triangles will be preserved in flat areas (allowing better shaped triangles)." isxmlparam="0" name="PlanarQuadric" description="Planar Simplification" type="RichBool" value="true"/>

  <Param tooltip="Use the Per-Vertex quality as a weighting factor for the simplification. The weight is used as a error amplification value, so a vertex with a high quality value will not be simplified and a portion of the mesh with low quality values will be aggressively simplified." isxmlparam="0" name="QualityWeight" description="Weighted Simplification" type="RichBool" value="false"/>
