# CAD MeshConverter

CAD MeshConverter is an open source tool, that allows the conversion of high detailed CAD Models into light weight models for AR/VR/MR Visualization. 

In order for AR applications to run smoothly on mobile devices (smartphones, data glasses), CAD models must be displayed in a simplified form.

The CADMeshConverter project makes it easier to start developing AR applications:

* Reduction of development costs
* No know-how in 3D modelling necessary
* Support for common data formats - Support for model preparation
* Establishment of a free solution
* open source

## Software modules

The project contains the following components
* The core module that performs the conversion process
* A REST API that needs to be run on a server and encapsulates the conversion process (swagger)
* A web application that can be used to test the conversion as well as custom scripts (some scripts are already included)
* An Android application to demonstrate the functionality
